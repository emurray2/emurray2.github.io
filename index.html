                    Roger Linn is the creator of hardware instruments used by many renowned musicians, such as Prince,
                    Michael Jackson, The Chemical Brothers, Green Day, and more. His LM-1 programmable drum machine 
                    was the first of its kind at the time. Linn also helped design products in other music companies, 
                    such as Akai's MPC60 and other products with Roland.

                    His company, Roger Linn Design, is a small business which he manages on his own to this day.
                    He doesn't have any emloyees, but he receives help from various contractors and friends with
                    aspects of the manufacturing process and software development.

                    When I interviewed Roger, I realized most of the questions he answered came with some
                    insightful economic and business advice. While it's easy to get caught up in the design
                    and creation process of an instrument, Roger reminded me of how important it is to
                    think like an entrepreneur. While entrepreneurs like Roger take risks to start their own
                    company and develop innovative hardware, they also learn over the course of their lifetime
                    how to be thrifty with their resources and learn from mistakes.
